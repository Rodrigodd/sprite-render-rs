# Sprite Render

A rust crate for rendering textured rects, with multiple backends (only two flavors of OpenGL for now).

## Backends
- [x] OpenGL 3.2
- [x] WebGl
- [ ] OpenGLES (for Android support)
- [ ] Directx11? Directx12? (I have windows at least)
- [ ] Vulkan? (My only device with vulkan support is a Android)
- [ ] Metal? (I don't have a Apple device)
- [ ] Wgpu? (I have write this to avoid the bloat of gfx-hal)
